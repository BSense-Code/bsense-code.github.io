        <h2>Cyber Defence Assesment Tool</h2>
        <p>I am currently working on a tool that will assess a company's or an individual's cyber defence. It will consider the effectiveness of each defence capability with the other capabilities that they have in place and give the user a rating of how good their security is. From here it will find the most effective defence capabilities the user should add to get the most protection from attacks and will also show the user which attacks they are protected against.</p>
